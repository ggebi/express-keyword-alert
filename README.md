## Getting Started

Copy the .env.example to .env

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

---

To get started with this repo npm install in the root folder

```bash
npm i --save
```

To getting started with a dev environment. Here we use nodemon and babel-node to restart the server asa we change
something

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

To transpile the code and create a production build

```bash
npm run transpile
```

This command will create a build in the root directory

To start with a production ready build you can run this command

```bash
# This set the NODE_ENV to production, npm-run-all, create a build and run the server command
npm run start
```

If you have a build and you want to node the build you can run

```bash
# This command launch the node instance inside the ./build/bin/www
npm run server
```

## Jest

```bash
# To launch all the tests that are in the tests folder
npm run test
```

## Docker Ready

### Here we use the multistage build to optimize speed and size of the final image

If you use Docker and wanna dockerize the app you can run the command

```bash
docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/<docker-image-name>:<tag> .
```

then

```bash
cd ./docker/mysql
docker compose up -d
cd ../redis
docker compose up -d
cd ../../
docker run --name <docker-process-name> -d - p 3000:3000 <dockerhubusername>/<docker-image-name>:<tag>
```
